"""Model-free n-gram / prompt-lookup drafter for the long-context spec-decode path.

Why this exists: over WAN, tok/s = g / (hops*RTT), where g = committed tokens per ring
traversal. A draft MODEL is the usual way to raise g, but the gpt-oss-20b draft OOMs at
100k context (its own KV blows the card), so spec-decode dies exactly where long context
needs it most. An n-gram drafter raises g with ZERO model and ZERO KV: it proposes the
continuation that followed the most recent earlier occurrence of the current suffix in the
text so far. At 100k context that text is huge and (for code / documents / structured data,
the latency-tolerant long-context demand) highly self-similar, so g climbs — for free.

Losslessness: this only PROPOSES. The distributed target verifies every proposed token in
the ring and greedy-commits the accepted prefix + one correction, so the output is bit-for-bit
the same greedy decode no matter how good or bad the proposals are. Proposal quality moves g
(speed), never correctness — so we're free to be heuristic here.

Fixed-shape contract: the fast-verify CUDA graph needs a fixed K+1-token chunk, so propose()
ALWAYS returns exactly k tokens (padded if the match runs short, or no match exists — a pad
token just gets rejected and the round still commits the one free verify token, i.e. it
degrades to plain decode, never worse).

Interface mirrors the async draft-socket the pipelined coordinator already speaks
(request -> fetch, one outstanding), so it drops into coordinate_pipe as `local_draft`:
    d.request(ids, k)   # snapshot the conditioning prefix (cheap)
    ds = d.fetch()      # exactly k proposed token ids

    earlier position whose continuation we copy. The index is grown forward as the committed
    sequence grows (O(appended) per round); on a divergence (the coordinator rewinds a short
    speculative tail) it re-indexes only from the divergence point — stale entries pointing
    past the new end are harmless (a bad proposal is just rejected). The whole search is a
    dict lookup, so it stays ~O(1) per round even at 100k context, fully hidden behind the
