"""scheduler / control plane — light and replaceable.

fits the target model to the currently-joined (heterogeneous) gpus, orders them
into a pipeline preferring low-latency edges, tracks health, and reassigns blocks
when a node drops. holds no weights and no user data, so decentralizing it later
(rotating/elected) is a follow-up, not a rewrite. hosted by the c0mpute
orchestrator at first.
