"""Signed per-stage receipts (PROVE) — the engine-side attestation that a node ran its block.

Over a job, each stage chains the sha256 of every (input, output) activation it processes and
signs the pair of running roots with its node key. The coordinator collects one receipt per stage
and hands the set to c0mpute on job:complete. Two properties fall out, both about *trustworthy
output and honest pay*:

  * a node cannot be PAID without producing a receipt signed by ITS key, and
  * the coordinator cannot FABRICATE a node's receipt (it lacks the key) — this kills
    coordinator-takes-all: pay is attributed per signed receipt, not by the coordinator's word.

The (in_root, out_root) slot is exactly where a cheap cryptographic proof-of-compute drops in
later — the economic-now -> crypto-later seam (docs/INTEGRATION.md §6). Today the roots are an
audit trail + the binding a layer-block challenge (shard/challenge.py) checks against; tomorrow
they carry a succinct proof that out = block(in) without re-execution.

Pure engine (boundary law): knows activations, hashes, node keys — nothing about c0mpute
accounts, $ZERO, or payment. shard PRODUCES the receipt; c0mpute CONSUMES it.

The node key is the node's ed25519 identity (the same key behind its libp2p PeerId, bound to a
c0mpute account in step 2.3). Receipt pubkey -> PeerId -> account is how c0mpute attributes pay.
