"""Content-addressed weight fetch (step 3, JOIN) — selective and byte-verified.

A node fetches ONLY its layer block's shards, from a pluggable provider, and verifies
every byte against the signed manifest before it lands in the model dir. Two properties
make this the trust root for weights:

  * selective  — a stage holding layers [lo:hi) downloads only the safetensors files
                 those layers (plus its boundary weights) live in, not the whole model.
                 NB byte savings track the checkpoint's shard packing, not 1/N: gpt-oss's
                 MXFP4 weight_map scatters layers across files (some straddle 3), so a
                 4-way split has stage 0 pull ~60% of bytes, not 25%. A future
                 re-shard-on-publish (contiguous layer order) recovers the full saving;
                 correctness + the trust property are unaffected either way.
  * verified   — fetch_block re-hashes every file itself, so a provider is never trusted.
                 A wrong byte → sha256 mismatch → the file is deleted and the load fails
                 closed. Corrupted weights cannot reach VRAM.

The **provider is a seam** (docs/INTEGRATION.md §4). A mirror (HTTP/HF) is the first
provider; libp2p content routing takes over at step 8 — additive, because the fetch was
content-verified from day one, so swapping the source changes nothing about trust.

Per the boundary law: pure engine. Knows about manifests, shards, and bytes — nothing
about c0mpute's catalog or accounts (the caller passes the pinned publisher pubkey in).
